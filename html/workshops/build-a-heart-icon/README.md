# Heart Icon

n a previous lesson, you learned about `svg` elements and how they're often used as icons in projects.

In real-world codebases, you would typically rely on icon libraries, so you don't need to create `svg` elements from scratch.

However, in this workshop, you'll build a `heart icon` to learn about the core attributes used inside an `svg` element.
