# Build a Curriculum Outline:
- This workshop will serve as your introduction to HTML and coding in general. You will learn about headings and paragraph elements.

## HTML:
- stands for HyperText Markup Language. 
- It's the code that defines the structure and content of a webpage.

## HTML is made up of elements:
- The first one you will use is the h1 element
- It starts with an opening tag (`<h1>`), ends with a closing tag (`</h1>`), and has the text it will display in between the tags.
- h1 element is the main heading of a webpage and you should only use one per page. h2 elements represent subheadings. You can have multiple per page and they look like this:

`<h2>This is a subheading.</h2>`

- There are six heading elements in HTML: h1 through h6.
- They're used to show the importance of sections on your webpage, with h1 being the most important and h6 the least.

- When you need to add a paragraph to a webpage, you can use the p element like this:

`<p>This is a paragraph element.</p>`
